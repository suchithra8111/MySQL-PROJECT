# MySQL-PROJECT
I have done a project based on MySQL.
The Library Management System (LMS)
project is a comprehensive solution for managing the various aspects of a library efficiently. Here's an expanded overview of its features and functionalities:

Book Management:

Cataloging: Store information about books such as title, author, publication date, genre, ISBN, and edition.
Availability Tracking: Keep track of the availability of each book, including the number of copies in stock and their current location within the library.
Classification: Organize books based on categories or genres to facilitate easy browsing and retrieval.
Employee Management:

Staff Information: Maintain records of library staff, including their contact details, roles, and responsibilities.
Access Control: Implement user roles and permissions to restrict access to sensitive information and functionalities.
Customer Management:

Member Registration: Allow patrons to register as library members, capturing necessary details like name, contact information, and membership type.
Membership Management: Manage membership status, renewal, and fees, if applicable.
Borrower Records: Keep track of borrowing history and preferences for each member.
Book Issuance and Returns.

OVERVIEW
The Library Management System project includes a database schema with tables for branches, employees, books, customers, issue status, and return status. These tables store information such as branch details, employee data, book information, customer records, and records of book issuances and returns. SQL queries are utilized to perform various operations within a library environment.

QUERIES IMPLEMENTED
1.Retrieve book title, category, and rental price of available books.
2.list employee names and salaries in descending order of salary.
3.Retrieve book titles and corresponding customers who have issued those books.
4.Display total count of books in each category.
5.Retrieve employee names and positions for employees with salaries below Rs.50,000.
6.List customer names who registered before 2022-01-01 and have not issued any books yet.
7.Display branch numbers and total count of employees in each branch.
8.Display names of customers who issued books in June 2023.
9.Retrieve book titles containing "history".
10.Retrieve branch numbers along with count of employees for branches having more than 5 employees.

IMPLEMENTED TEN ADDITIONAL QUERIES.
